# Local developer config for PyO3 builds.
#
# Copy this file to `.cargo/config.toml` to make `cargo test` pick the repo's
# Python virtualenv (used by `uv`) instead of whatever `python3` points to on
# your system.
#
# Notes:
# - This is intended for local development only; CI should keep setting
#   `PYO3_PYTHON` explicitly.
# - Run Cargo commands from the repo root so the relative path resolves.
#
#   cp .cargo/config.toml.example .cargo/config.toml
