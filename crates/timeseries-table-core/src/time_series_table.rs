//! High-level time-series table abstraction.
//!
//! This wraps the transaction log and table state into a single, user-facing
//! type that knows:
//! - where the table lives (`TableLocation`),
//! - how to talk to the transaction log (`TransactionLogStore`),
//! - what the current committed state is (`TableState`),
//! - and what the time index spec is (`TimeIndexSpec`).
//!
//! In v0.1 this is intentionally read-heavy and write-light:
//! - `open` reconstructs state from the transaction log,
//! - `create` bootstraps a fresh table with an initial metadata commit.
//!   Later issues will add append APIs, coverage, and scanning.
